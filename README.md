# HW 3: Heaps

## Overview
This program is part of the course **Data Structures & Object-Oriented Design** and implements a **logic circuit simulator** in C++.  
The program models digital circuits composed of gates, wires, and events, and simulates how signals propagate through the circuit over time.

The assignment emphasizes **object-oriented design, abstraction, and event-driven simulation**, with careful coordination between multiple interacting components to correctly model circuit behavior.

## Features
- Object-oriented modeling of logic gates and wires
- Event-based simulation of signal changes
- Circuit-level coordination of components
- Dynamic interaction between gates, wires, and events
- Modular design separating circuit logic and execution
- Build automation using a Makefile

## Notes
Completed during Fall 2025.
